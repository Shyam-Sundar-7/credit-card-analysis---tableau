The raw data consists of 26 columns, which are categorized into various segments, including infrastructural, credit card, and debit card information. For this project, we focused on the credit card data to extract valuable insights.

# Data Preparation
We conducted extensive data cleaning and consolidation to create a single dataset named "July-Sept 2023 Credit Card Analysis." The data preparation steps included:

- Extraction of credit card details from the raw data.
- Cleaning and formatting the data to ensure accuracy.
- Combining data from July, August, and September 2023 into a single dataset.
